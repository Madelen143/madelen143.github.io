						<li>
							<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> Gestalt (German for "form" or "shape") principles explain  how 
								people see visual elements. Connections between
								objects such as similar shape, symmetry,
								and grouping show connections that we see between 
								objects.
							</p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> The visual elements that helped 
								describe each section gave me a good idea of 
								how these elements are used in web design. I also liked
							how each section had its own reccomendation on where to use
							each design principle.</p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>Copy and paste a quote you found compelling, interesting, or cool</p>
							<p> "User Interface Design isn’t all about pretty pixels and sparkly graphics. It’s mainly about communication, performance and convenience."
								This quote is here to remind us that front-end design is about
							both form and function and how these go hand in hand. It can be easy to lose 
						yourself in the animations, transitions and look of things. It's much harder
					to create a simple yet effective design that is good on performance.  </p>
						</li>
					</ul>

					<ul>
						<li>
							<p>On a scale from 1 to 10, how much did you enjoy reading this article? If you scored below a five, please briefly explain why.</p>
							<p>10! The article was a great balance of explaination and visuals and was enough content to 
								make me feel like I understood what was being said without feeling like I was reading an essay. </p>
