<h2>Reading Responses</h2>
<ul>
    <li>I learned how breaking down a page makes you realize the different components and what is emphasized</li>
    <li>My favorite part was when I was asked to open up an app and think about hierarchy/content/intent/audience. </li>
    <li>" By routinely analyzing other apps, youâ€™ll develop your product thinking and get better at designing apps yourself."
        Probably what a bunch of other people copied, but it makes me want to be more aware of everything.</li>
    <li>7/10 I liked that it was a light read but I wish there was a bit more meat to it. For example breaking down
        some of the more trendy design elements and why they work or if there were any studies done on this.</li>
