					<ul>
						<li>
							<p>Using the favorite website you chose in homework 1, create a wireframe for one page of it using pen/paper, PowerPoint, or any your tool of choice. (use the 'img' tag!) Make sure to let us know what the name of your website is (Use the 'p' tag!)</p>
							<p> Wireframe = diagram or set of diagrams that consist of simple lines
								and shapes representing the skeleton of a website or an applicaiton's 
								user interface and core functionality </p>
							<img src="assets/imgs/IMG_0899.heif" >
						
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>Try to improve the website you've chosen, and create a redesigned wireframe of one page for the same website using the principles of visual hierarchy that you learned from the article.</p>
							<img src="assets/imgs/IMG_0904.heif" >
						</li>
					</ul>

					<div class="body-header">Responses</div>
					<ul>
						<li>
							<p>What is the goal of the website? Who is it intended for? How does the design accomplish this? Write 2-3 sentences answering these questions. (Use the 'p' tag again!)</p>
							<p> The goal of the website is to sell products. It is intended mostly for people looking
								for unique items that aren't usually sold in commercial stores. The items are 
							handmade and have character. Although it is a collection of people's small shops,
							Etsy feels like a cohesive store and places a lot of emphasis on the visual design of its 
							site, adding charm to its company and easily competing with other name brand stores. </p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p> Write 2-3 sentences about what problems your redesign addressed, and how it solved them.</p>
							<p> When I opened the site again, it was showing me a line of recently reviewed items.
								I would have liked the site to place those at the bottom as it ruined the upfront design
							for me in that moment. I wish the site would have been more subtle with tracking me. For example
							 if my last search was earrings then next time the site could display earrings that are 
							most popular or curated based off of the ones I was looking at. The site also repeated the same
							circle categories halfway down the page which I did not like. Having only one of those at the top
							brought attention to it. 
						</p>
						</li>
						<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> Make sure to include the wireframe images in the website and don't just put it in your assets folder!</p></li>
						<p>Your wireframes should look something like this:</p>
				<img class="img-scaled" src="assets/imgs/wireframe.png"/>
